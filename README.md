# Rouge [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rouge-lang/rouge.png)](http://travis-ci.org/rouge-lang/rouge)

**Ruby + Clojure = Rouge.**

Why?

* Clojure is elegant and fun.
* Quick boot time (currently around 0.1s).
* Ruby's gems tend to be modern with decent APIs.

<!-- You can try a Rouge REPL online at **[Try Rouge](http://try.rouge.io)**, or -->

Install the gem to get the local REPL:

``` bash
gem install rouge-lang
rouge
```

You'll see the `user=>` prompt.  Enjoy!

You can discuss on Google Groups' [rouge-talk](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rouge-talk),
or on `#rouge` on Freenode.

## example

See [boot.rg](https://github.com/rouge-lang/rouge/blob/master/lib/boot.rg),
[em-rg](https://github.com/kivikakk/em-rg),
[mechanize-rg](https://github.com/kivikakk/mechanize-rg), but to demonstrate
salient features:

``` clojure
; define a macro
(defmacro defn [name args & body]
  `(def ~name (fn ~name ~args ~@body)))

; call a Ruby method on Kernel (if the ruby namespace is referred)
(defn require [lib]
  (.require Kernel lib))

; call a Ruby method on an Array with a block argument
(defn reduce [f coll]
  (.inject coll | f))

; using Ruby's AMQP gem with an inline block
(.subscribe queue {:ack true} | [metadata payload]
  (puts (str "got a message: " payload))
  (.ack metadata))
```

What about in Rails?

```
$ rails console -- -rrouge
Loading development environment (Rails 3.2.6)
1.9.3p194 :002 > Rouge.repl
user=> (.where ruby/Content {:id 1})
  Content Load (0.7ms)  SELECT "contents".* FROM "contents" WHERE "contents"."id" = 1
[#<Content id: 1, content_group_id: 1, name: "welcome", content: "blah blah", created_at: "2012-08-26 11:30:50", updated_at: "2012-08-26 11:50:27", order: nil>]
user=>
```
